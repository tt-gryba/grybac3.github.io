<p>TT Score is a trade surveillance tool that uses pattern recognition based on machine learning to identify trading behaviors that pose the greatest regulatory risk to your firm. It scores all activity based on similarity to actual regulatory cases such that compliance officers can identify risk, prioritize work and address problematic trading behavior. </p>

<p>TT Score is an integrated component of the TT platform that requires no implementation or integration and can simply be activated in Setup. Through the TT platform, TT Score has immediate access to trading data.  TT Score also lets users with order and fill data from outside the TT platform <a href="./imp-import.html">import their data</a> into TT Score through the TT FIX Inbound Drop Copy service.</p>

<p>TT Score features a number of data visualizations and filters to assist in the review and evaluation of trading activity and provides the ability to record dispositions.</p>
