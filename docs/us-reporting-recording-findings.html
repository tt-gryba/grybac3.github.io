title: Recording reviews and opening investigations

{% include video.html %}

<p>Having analyzed the trading activity, you are ready to begin reviewing the clusters to determine whether additional investigation is needed. During the review process, TT Score lets you attach notes to individual clusters and to daily cluster groups to record your dispositions. To provide traceability, TT Score maintains a historical record of all notes that are added to a cluster or cluster group.</p>

<h2 id="cluster">Reviewing clusters and cluster groups</h2>
<p>In TT Score, you can review clusters or cluster groups and provide disposition comments of your review. For clusters with higher risk scores, you can examine the behavior more closely and create notes of your findings. When reviewing clusters with lower scores, you can simply add a note that the cluster has been reviewed.</p>

<p>Reviews can be started from the <a href="glv-list-view.html">Cluster List</a> and <a href="glv-daily-cluster-group.html">Daily Cluster Groups</a> view.</p>

<p>To add review clusters and cluster groups:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Display the Cluster List or Daily Cluster Groups view for the selected dates and models.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-1.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		For an individual cluster (or cluster group), click <strong>Inspect</strong>.
		<p></p>
		The Cluster Scorecard for the selected cluster appears.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-2.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Evaluate the cluster details to determine whether problematic trading activity might have occurred; then click <strong>Review Cluster</strong>.
		<p></p>
		The Review panel appears at the left.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-3.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Enter any notes you want to include with the review, and click <strong>Add Note</strong>.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-4.png" alt=""/></p>
		In the Cluster List, the <strong>Reviewed</strong> column for the cluster now shows <strong>true</strong> to indicate that the cluster has been reviewed.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-5.png" alt=""/></p>
		<!--
		Note: Only by adding a note does the Reviewed status change to true. TT recommends that you review all clusters for thoroughness, even those with low risk scores. You can add some text indicating that a cluster showed no risk.
		-->
	</li>
	<!--
	<li>
		If desired, you can review the cluster again to verify the note was added. You can also add more notes to the cluster.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-6.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	-->
</ol>
<p>You have successfully added review notes to a cluster. If suspect that a cluster or cluster group requires a more detailed analysis, you can begin an investigation with the reviews you create.</p>

<h2 id="group">Reviewing cluster groups</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Display the Daily Cluster Groups for the desired dates and models.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/.png" alt="Daily Cluster Groups image"/></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		For a cluster group, click Review/Investigate.
		<p></p>
		The Review panel appears at the left.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/.png" alt="Group Review image" /></p>

	<li>
		Enter any notes you want to include for the cluster group, and click <strong>Add Note</strong>.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/.png" alt="Add Note image" /></p>
		In the Daily Cluster Groups, notice that the <strong>Reviewed</strong> column for the cluster group now shows <strong>true</strong> to indicate that the cluster group has been reviewed.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/.png" alt="Reviewed true image" /></p>
		Note: Only by adding a note does the Reviewed status change to true. TT recommends that you review all cluster groups for thoroughness, even those with low risk scores. You can add some text indicating that a cluster group showed no risk.
	</li>
	<li>
		If desired, you can review the cluster group again to verify the note was added. You can also add more notes to the cluster.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/.png" alt="Show Group Note image" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		If you want to examine and review the individual clusters in the cluster group, click View Clusters.
		<p></p>
		A Cluster List displays only those clusters in the group.

<h2 id="bulk-review">Creating a bulk review</h2>

<p>The cluster list and group views also provide you with the ability to mark all clusters for the selected model and dates as being "reviewed". You can then conduct further investigations of each cluster as needed.</p>

<p>To create a bulk review:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Display the Cluster List or Daily Cluster Groups view for the selected dates and models.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-1.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <b>Bulk Review</b> in the upper right corner of the cluster list or group view.

				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/bulk-review.png" alt=""/></p>

				<li>Add notes to the bulk review dialog box as needed and click <b>Review</b>.
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/bulk-review-dialog.png" alt=""/></p>

					<p>All clusters for the selected data are marked as "Reviewed".</p>

				</li>
</ol>




<h2>Adding cluster reviews to an investigation</h2>
<p>After reviewing various clusters or cluster groups, you might determine that more investigation or follow-up is required. If so, you can open an investigation from a review or add your reviews to an existing investigation. Using investigations lets you create dispositions for problematic trading activity that occurs across multiple clusters or even across multiple traders and accounts.</p>
<p>To start an investigation into a cluster or cluster group:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Start a review for a <a href="#cluster">cluster</a> or <a href="#cluster">cluster group</a>.
		<p></p>
		As you can see, the notes you previously entered are now a part of the cluster's review history.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/review-one-cluster-6.png" alt="" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In the <b>Type Investigation Name</b> field, enter a name for the investigation and click <b>Create New Investigation</b>.</p>
		
		<p hidden><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/us-create-investigation.png" /></p>
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/investigation-start-2.png" alt=""/></p>
		<p></p>
		Alternatively, you can select an existing investigation and click <strong>Add to Existing Investigation</strong> to add this review to the investigation.
		<p></p>
		The investigation is added to the OPEN INVESTIGATIONS section of the TT Score Dashboard.
		<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/score-dashboard.png" alt=""/></p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>You have successfully added a cluster review to an investigation.</p>


<h2>Managing investigations</h2>
<p>From the TT Score Dashboard, you can view existing investigations. Within each investigation report you can track the investigaton's progress, assign a different owner to manage the investigation, and add comments or a final disposition with attachments.</p>
