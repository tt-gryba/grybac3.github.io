title: Exchange Messaging Rate Limit
---


<p>The Exchange Messaging Rate Limit model flags instances where a trader exceeds, or nearly exceeds, the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Messaging+Controls">exchange's messaging rate limits</a>. By reviewing instances of excessive messaging rates in a TT Score cluster, compliance officers can identify potentially suspect trading activity on a per trader basis.
</p>

 <p><b>Note</b>: This model currently only covers exchanges supported on CME Globex.</p>

<h2>Scoring methodology</h2>


<p>TT Score identifies where traders have exceeded the exchange-defined maximum messaging rate limit for at least a three second period throughout the trading day. If one or more three-second "bursts" are identified or if the messaging rate of the burst far exceeds the exchange maximum rate in a cluster, a higher score will be assigned to that Exchange Messaging Rate Limit cluster.
</p>



<h3>Score interpretation</h3>
<p>The score assigned to a cluster is based on a sliding scale between 0-100 using a weighted calculation. A score of 75 and above is a good indication that the suspect trading activity occurred.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Scorecard metrics</h3>

<p>The Exchange Messaging Rate Limits cluster scorecard includes metrics that help you identify where excessive messaging rates occurred on a per trader basis.</p>

  <p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/exchange-messaging-rate-metrics.png"></p>

<p>Included metrics are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Burst number</b> &mdash; The three-second interval of data selected in the cluster scorecard chart.
<li><b>Count</b>: The message rate per second during the interval.
<li><b>StartTime</b>: Start time of the three-second burst interval.
<li><b>StopTime</b>: End time of the three-second burst interval.
<li><b>Type</b> &mdash; The type of high-level trading activity: "Cancels" or "Non-Cancels".
</ul>





<h2 id="id">Identifying excessive messaging rates</h2>

<p>In addition to the scorecard metrics, the Exchange Messaging Rate Limits chart and Audit Trail can help identify intervals of excessive messaging rates.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/exchange-messaging-rate-example3.png" /></p>


<p>To inspect an Exchange Messaging Rate Limits cluster in TT Score:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click on a burst displayed in the chart.</p>
<p>The chart will only highlight instances when the messaging rate exceeded the exchange maximum rate limit for a period of three seconds.</p>
<li><p>Review the burst metrics highlighted in the metrics scorecard.</p>
<p>In this example, the second messaging rate burst is selected (Burst 2). The messaging rate per second for the interval is shown by the <b>Count</b> metric. The <b>Type</b> metric shows that the excessive messages were "non-cancel" order actions.</p>
</li>

<li><p>To further inspect the trading activity during the selected burst interval, click an order row in the Audit Trail.
</p>
<p>Only the order activity for the selected burst is displayed. In this example, the price was continuously requoted for the duration of the three-second interval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
