<p>The Cluster Scorecard view provides a summary of the vital statistics of the cluster as well as an initial visualization of the pattern that was formed by the order and fill messages that comprised the cluster. You can laos view the activity in the cluster in the context of the market data at the time.</p>
	<p>Clicking the <strong>Inspect</strong> button in the <strong>Actions</strong> column of the <a href="glv-list-view.html">Cluster List View</a> opens the scorecard for the selected cluster.</p>

<h2>Cluster Scorecard display</h2>


<p>The Cluster Scorecard is organized into the following sections.</p>

	<img class="img-responsive" src="Content/rpt-cluster-scorecard-display.png" />

<h2 id="replay">Market Replay</h2>
<p>The <strong>Market Replay</strong> section of the Cluster Scorecard lets users view the cluster data overlaid on the market data as it occurred over time. Click <b>Load MD Trader</b> to display the market replay ladder and playback 
	controls.</p>


		<p>	<img class="img-responsive" src="Content/rpt-cluster-scorecard-controls.png" /></p>


	<p>Users can display the replay data with the following views:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Ladder view</strong>: Replays the market activity in a ladder-like interface as it occurred during the time period covered by the cluster.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Macro view</strong>: Displays the trader's activity in the context of of market conditions at multiple price levels during the time period covered by the cluster.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="ladder-view">Ladder view</h3>
<p>The Ladder view is a research tool that provides users with a frame-by-frame replay of the trading activity overlaid with Level 2 market data on a ladder-style interface. The ladder is 10 ticks deep and displays all market data, including the orders for each relevant participant in the order book. Users can stop, start and rewind the playback of the activity within a given cluster in order to gain a precise understanding of the sequence of events that occurred in the order book and how the trader’s orders impacted the market.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/cv-ladder-replay.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The ladder view includes the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Interactive display of the market ladder for the specified time frame.
	</li>
	<li>
		Graph of trading activity showing buy and sell orders along with a bar indicating the current time in the replay.
	</li>
	<li>
		List of Audit Trail messages that comprise the activity included in the Market Replay.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Click Play to watch the market react as the order activity in the audit messages are replayed. As the market replays, a vertical bar tracks the progress in the graph and the audit messages are added as they occur. The Audit Message section lists the history of every audit message generated from the start of the replay to the current point in time of the market replay. You can start, stop and rewind the activity to help get a clearer picture of potentially problematic trading activity.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/cv-ladder-display.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The market replay includes the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Total number of frames in the replay and the frame number currently being displayed.
	</li>
	<li>
		Interactive controls to play and rewind trading activity in the ladder.
	</li>
	<li>
		Price ladder and state of the market at the indicated time.
