title: Generating Reports in TT Score
---


<p>As a Score administrator, you can generate compliance reports that quantify cluster statistics for your entire company and for individual traders. Reports can be generated from the "Reports" tab on the Score dashboard. Existing compliance reports can also be viewed on this tab.</p>

<p>The following types of reports can be generated in TT Score:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#summary">Summary Stats</a> &mdash; Summary statistics of clusters over a given time period.</li>
		<li><a href="#process">Processing Stats</a> &mdash; Daily processing statistics.</li>
		<li><a href="#trends">Summary Stats Trends</a> &mdash; A trends report for the summary statistics.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<p>After generating a report, you can select which statistics to display and download each set of data from the report as needed.
</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: You must have <a href="ovw-accessing-tt-score.html#admin">administrator permissions in Setup</a> in order to generate reports. As a TT Score administrator, you can generate reports for your company and view data for all accounts that your users have access to, including accounts shared with your company. As a TT Score account administrator, you can generate reports only for the accounts assigned to you.</p>
