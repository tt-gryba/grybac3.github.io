<h2>Review workflow</h2>

<p>Selected data is best reviewed by focusing on one problematic trading model at a time. You begin by filtering the data for an individual model.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Selected filters are applied to the data only after you click the <strong>Apply Filters</strong> button.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Conduct a <strong>cluster group review</strong> to identify cluster groups that need further examination using one of the Cluster Group views. Use the links below for information on using these views to identify problematic cluster groups:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="glv-group-view-outlier-chart.html#outlier-chart">Outlier chart</a></li>
			<li><a href="glv-group-view-heat-map.html#heat-map">Heat Map</a></li>
			<li><a href="glv-daily-cluster-group.html">Daily Cluster Groups</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Selecting a problematic cluster group will open the Cluster List with filters applied to to view only the clusters in this group. Conduct a <a href="glv-list-view.html#interpreting">cluster list review</a> to identify individual clusters to review.
	</li>
	<li>For each identified cluster, you conduct a <strong>cluster review</strong>.
		<p></p>
		Cluster review methods vary by problemattic trading model. Consult this <a href="cv-identifying-problematic-activity.html">summary of cluster review methods</a> for more information.
	</li>
	<li>
		After completing a cluster review, you <a href="cv-cluster-view-cluster-scorecard.html#cluster-review">write your disposition for the cluster</a> using the Cluster Scorecard.
	</li>
	<li>
		After all problematic clusters are reviewed, return to step 1, select a different Cluster Group view and repeat steps 2 through 4.
		<p></p>
		<strong>Note</strong>: Filtering out clusters that have already been reviewed makes it easier to differentiate cluster groups that have been reviewed from cluster groups that still require review.
	</li>
	<li>Finally, after you have used each cluster group view and reviewed the relevant clusters within each group, you <a href="glv-group-view-alerts.html#group-review">record your disposition for each group</a> in the Daily Cluster Groups view.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have completed your review for one of the models and can now move on to the next problematic trading model by adjusting your MODELS filter.</p>
