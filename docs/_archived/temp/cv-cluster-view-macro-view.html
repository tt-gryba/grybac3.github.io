title: Cluster Macro View
---

<p>The Macro View is a visualization that displays a trader's order actions and executions in the context of market conditions at multiple price levels over time. This view is used to conduct a <a href="cv-identifying-problematic-activity.html">cluster review</a> by allowing for a rapid assessment of the traderâ€™s pattern of activity and any corresponding market reaction.</p>

<p>Note: You must load the market data in the <a href="cv-cluster-view-cluster-scorecard.html#replay">MARKET REPLAY</a> section before you can display the <strong>Macro View</strong> tab.</p>

<p>The Macro View display shows the change in the available liquidity at each price level over time. Each row represents a price level and displays the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Light red shows asks in the market</li>
        <li>Dark red shows the trader's working asks</li>
        <li>Light blue shows bids</li>
        <li>Dark blue shows the trader's working bids</li> 
        <li>Executed orders are represented as circles for sells and triangles for buys.</li>
    </ol>

<p>The Macro View also contains a legend that describes the color scheme. You can click the colors to hide or show the corresponding data in the Macro View.</p>

<p>By hovering the mouse on a specific data point, you can see the exact value at that time. For example, by hovering over a light blue area, you can see the exact bid liquidity in the market at that point in time.</p>
