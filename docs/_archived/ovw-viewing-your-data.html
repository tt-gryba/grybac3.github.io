title: Viewing Your Data
---

<p>TT Score allows you to generate unique data visualizations to assist you in understanding where the risks are in your data, how the risks are distributed, and how the risks are changing over time. These presentations of data provide regulators and compliance staff with the ability to identify and take proactive steps to prevent disruptive or manipulative trading activity before it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of views available in TT Score:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#summary-views">Summary Views</a> </li>
	<li><a href="#detail-views">Detail Views</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary-views">Summary Views</h2>

<p>The Summary views available within TT Score assist users in conducting overviews of their trading data to identify clusters that may require additional scrutiny. The following Summary views can be generated in TT Score: Heat Map, Outlier Chart, Rainbow List, and Alerts.</p>

	<h4>Heat Map</h4>
	<p>The <a href="glv-group-view-heat-map.html">Heat Map</a> displays a collection of blocks representing groups of clusters. The size and color of each block indicate the number of clusters and severity of risk scores.</p>

    </p>  

    <h4>Outlier Chart</h4>
	<p>The <a href="glv-group-view-outlier-chart.html">Outlier Chart</a> displays every entity’s percent of high-risk clusters compared to the total clusters on a single screen. This allows for easy detection of problematic trading in big data sets with disparate customer or trader cluster volumes.</p>

	<h4>Rainbow List</h4>
	<p>The <a href="glv-list-view.html">Rainbow List</a> includes all clusters generated by a TraderID or account, color-coded by risk score. Each list item expands to display details about that cluster.</p>

	<h4>Alerts</h4>
	<p>The <a href="glv-group-view-alerts.html">Alerts</a> view provides users the ability to add a single review disposition for all of the clusters generated by a particular trader in a single instrument for the trading day, as opposed to providing a disposition for each individual cluster.</p>

<h2 id="detail-views">Detail Views</h2>

	<p>The Detail views provide tools to examine the details of individual clusters and investigate trader activity in the context of market conditions. The following Detail views can be generated in TT Score: Cluster Scorecard, Market Ladder Replay, and Macro View.</p>

	<h4>Cluster Scorecard</h4>
	<p>The <a href="rpt-detail-view-cluster-scorecard.html">Cluster Scorecard</a> provides a summary of the vital statistics of the cluster as well as an initial visualization of the pattern that was formed by the order and fill messages that comprised the cluster.</p>

	<h4>Market Ladder Replay</h4>
	<p>The <a href="rpt-detail-view-ladder-replay.html">Market Ladder Replay</a> provides users with a frame-by-frame replay of the trading activity overlaid with Level 2 market data on a ladder-style interface. The ladder is 10 ticks deep and displays all market data, including the orders for each relevant participant in the order book.</p>

	<h4>Macro View</h4>
	<p>The <a href="rpt-detail-view-macro-view.html">Macro View</a> provides the same detail as the Market Ladder Replay, but visualizes both the Level 2 market and the trader’s data for the entire length of the cluster on a single screen.</p>
