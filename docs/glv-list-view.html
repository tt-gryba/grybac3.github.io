title: Cluster List View
---

<p>The Cluster List view shows individual clusters created from the selected dates. Each row of this sortable list is highlighted with a color to indicate the severity of that cluster's risk score.</p>


<h2 id="display">Cluster List display</h2>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/cluster-list-display.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The Cluster List display is organized into the following sections:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#interpret">Cluster List</a>: Displays the Cluster List view of the selected dates' data as well as filtering and navigation tools.</li>
		<!-- <li><a href="#statistical-summary">Summary Statistics Panel</a>: Shows metrics about the selected data in the current view.
		</li> -->
		<li><a href="#data-selection-panel">Data Selection Panel</a>: Manages the dates available to TT Score and specifies the criteria to use when populating the list.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="interpret">Interpreting the Cluster List</h2>

<p>The Cluster List is used to conduct a cluster list review. Once a problematic cluster group is identified, you can inspect the individual clusters contained in that group using the <a href="cv-cluster-view-cluster-scorecard.html">Cluster Scorecard</a>. This <strong>Score</strong> column is color coded using a graduated scale tied to the risk score, transitioning from red through yellow to green and pale green as scores decrease.</p>

<p>While conducting a cluster list review, it can be helpful to:<p>

<ul>
	<li>Filter out lower scoring clusters using the <strong>Score</strong> filter to make larger datasets more navigable.</li>
	<li>Sort the list by <strong>Start Time</strong> to see if higher scoring clusters bunch up at particular times of day.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/cluster-list-example.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The Cluster List displays the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    	<strong>Score</strong>: Risk score calculated for the cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Model</strong>: Type of risk highlighted in the cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Trader</strong>: Trader ID used for the cluster's trading activity.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Account</strong>: Account used for the cluster's trading activity.
    </li>
     <li>
    	<strong>Instrument</strong>: ID of the instrument whose activity is contained in the cluster.
    </li> 
    <li>
    	<strong>Exchange</strong>: Exchange where the instrument was traded.
    </li>
    <li>
    	<strong>Cluster Start Time</strong>: Cluster start time with microsecond precision.
    </li>
   
    
    <li>
    	<strong>Reviewed</strong>: Shows whether the cluster has been reviewed by compliance officers (Yes or No).
    </li> 
    <li>
    	<strong>Actions</strong>: Allows you to inspect and review the cluster details.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>Clicking on a square on the heat map will display all the scored results for that trader, when the event happened, the score and the model that the event refers to. The list is sorted in decreasing score so the most important clusters are at the top of the list. This view is color coded using a graduated scale tied to the risk score, transitioning from red through yellow to green and pale green as scores decrease.</p>
<p>The Rainbow List View is also available via the Treemap/List Toggle described earlier.</p>
