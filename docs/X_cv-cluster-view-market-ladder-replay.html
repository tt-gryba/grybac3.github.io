<p>Market Ladder Replay is a research tool that provides users with a frame-by-frame replay of the trading activity overlaid with
Level 2 market data on a ladder-style interface. The ladder is 10 ticks deep and displays all market data, including the orders for
each relevant participant in the order book. Users can stop, start and rewind the playback of the activity within a given cluster in order to gain a precise understanding of the sequence of events that occurred in the order book and how the traderâ€™s orders impacted the
market.</p>
