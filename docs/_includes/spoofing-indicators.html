 <h2 id="id">Spoofing Indicators</h2>


  <p>The chart on the Cluster Scorecard may also show "imbalanced fill" and "market flip" indicators to help easily identify when the potential spoofing occurred.</p>

<p>The <b>imbalanced fill indicator</b> is a green diamond above a fill that indicates where the trader had an imbalance between the bid and offer and was filled on orders on the small side of the imbalance.</p>

<p>The <b>market flip indicator</b> shows where a trader quickly flipped from offering to bidding (or vice versa) at the same price. The triangle indicator is either red (flipped short) or blue (flipped long).</p>
