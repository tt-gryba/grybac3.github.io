title: Cluster Group View - Outlier Chart
---

<p>To allow for easy detection of problematic groups of clusters in big data sets with disparate customer or trader cluster volumes, the Outlier chart displays the percentage of high-risk clusters within an group's total clusters. </p>

<h2>Outlier Chart display</h2>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="Content/new-rpt-outlier-display.png" alt=""></p>



<p>The Outlier Chart display is organized into the following sections:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#outlier-chart">Outlier Chart</a>: Displays the Outlier view of the loaded data as well as filtering and navigation tools.</li>
	<!--	<li><a href="#statistical-summary">Summary Statistics Panel</a>: Shows metrics about the selected data in the 
	current view.</li> -->
		<li><a href="#data-selection-panel">Data Selection Panel</a>: Manages the dates available to TT Score and specifies the criteria to use when populating the list.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="outlier-chart">Interpreting the Outlier Chart</h2>


<p>The Outlier Chart displays every cluster group's percentage of clusters with a score above a threshold defined by the user. This allows for easy detection of problematic trading in big data sets with disparate customer or trader cluster volumes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  	The color of the dot indicates the severity of the score, with low scores represented as dark green and becoming yellow and finally dark red as risk scores increase.
  </li>
  <li>
  	The position of a dot in the X-axis indicates the number of clusters contained in the dot.
  </li>
  <li>
  	The position of a dot in the Y-axis indicates the percentage of clusters that exceeded the score.
  </li>
</ul>
